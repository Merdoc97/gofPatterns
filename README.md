# Design Patterns Implementation in Java

## What This Project Covers

This project provides a comprehensive implementation of design patterns from the "Gang of Four" (GoF) design patterns catalog, with a focus on behavioral patterns. Each pattern is implemented in Java with a clear, well-documented structure that demonstrates:

1. **Behavioral Design Patterns**: A collection of patterns that focus on algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects, including:
   - Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable
   - Command Pattern: Turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request
   - Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified
   - Template Method Pattern: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses
   - Visitor Pattern: Allows adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying them

2. **Clean Implementation**: Each pattern implementation includes:
   - Interface and class definitions with proper Java documentation
   - Clear separation of concerns following SOLID principles
   - Practical examples that demonstrate pattern usage
   - Comprehensive UML diagrams showing relationships between components

3. **Educational Resources**: For each pattern, you'll find:
   - Detailed README files explaining the intent of the pattern
   - Various types and variations of the pattern
   - Guidelines on when to use the pattern
   - Real-world examples where the pattern is commonly applied

4. **Visual Documentation**: UML diagrams created with PlantUML to visually represent the structure and relationships of each pattern implementation.

## For Whom This Project Is Intended

This project is designed for:

1. **Software Developers and Engineers**: 
   - Those looking to improve their understanding of design patterns and how to implement them in Java
   - Developers who want to apply these patterns in their own projects
   - Engineers seeking reference implementations to solve specific design problems

2. **Students and Educators**:
   - Computer Science and Software Engineering students learning about design patterns
   - Instructors teaching software design principles and looking for practical examples
   - Self-learners following a structured approach to master design patterns

3. **Technical Interviewees and Interviewers**:
   - Job candidates preparing for technical interviews that may include design pattern questions
   - Interviewers looking for standard implementations to compare with candidates' solutions

4. **Software Architects**:
   - Professionals responsible for designing software systems
   - Architects looking to evaluate different design patterns for specific scenarios
   - Team leads who want to establish common design vocabulary and practices

5. **Code Reviewers**:
   - Developers responsible for reviewing others' code and suggesting improvements
   - Team members looking to establish coding standards based on proven design principles

The implementations are deliberately kept simple and focused on the pattern structure rather than specific business domains, making them adaptable to various contexts and easy to understand regardless of industry background.

## Getting Started

To explore this project:

1. Browse the package structure to find specific patterns
2. Each pattern has its own package (e.g., `ua.bot.behaviour.strategy`)
3. Read the README.md file in each pattern's package to understand its purpose and usage
4. Examine the UML diagram to visualize the pattern structure
5. Study the Java implementation to see the pattern in code
6. Run the demo class (e.g., `StrategyPatternDemo`) to see the pattern in action

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add more patterns, improve existing implementations, or enhance documentation, please feel free to submit a pull request.
