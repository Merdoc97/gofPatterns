# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

## Intent
The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that creates a chain of handler objects to process a request. It allows multiple objects to handle a request without the sender needing to know which object will ultimately process it. The pattern creates a chain of receiver objects for a request, with each receiver containing a reference to the next receiver. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it along the chain. This decoupling allows for dynamic rearrangement of handler responsibilities at runtime.

## Types of Chain of Responsibility Pattern

1. **Standard Chain**: The classic implementation where each handler has a reference to the next handler, and processing stops when a handler handles the request or the chain ends.

2. **Interface-Based Chain**: Uses interfaces instead of abstract classes to define the handler protocol, allowing for greater flexibility in implementation.

3. **Command-Processor Chain**: Combines the Chain of Responsibility pattern with the Command pattern, where handlers process command objects.

4. **Linked List Chain**: Implements the chain using a linked list data structure, which can simplify chain construction and modification.

5. **Pipeline Chain**: All handlers in the chain process the request in sequence, with each handler performing a specific transformation or action.

6. **Composite Chain**: Combines the Chain of Responsibility pattern with the Composite pattern, allowing for complex hierarchical chains.

7. **Dynamic Chain**: The chain structure can be modified at runtime based on conditions or requirements.

8. **Intercepting Filter Chain**: Particularly used in web applications, where each filter in the chain performs a specific aspect of request/response processing.

## When to Use the Chain of Responsibility Pattern

Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when:

1. **More than one object may handle a request**: When multiple objects can handle a request and the handler isn't known a priori.

2. **You want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly**: When the sender doesn't need to know which object will handle the request.

3. **The set of objects that can handle a request should be specified dynamically**: When you want to be able to change the chain or add new handlers at runtime.

4. **You want to decouple the sender of a request from its receivers**: When the sender shouldn't be directly connected to the objects that might handle its request.

5. **You want to implement a system with hierarchical request handling**: When requests should be handled at different levels according to certain criteria.

6. **You need to process different types of requests in various ways, but the request type isn't known in advance**: When the exact processing depends on the request type or contents.

7. **You need to execute several handlers in a particular order**: When processing requires a sequence of operations across different objects.

8. **The responsibilities of objects should be dynamic**: When object responsibilities can change during program execution.

## Real-World Examples

1. **Exception Handling**: In many programming languages, exceptions propagate up the call stack until an appropriate handler is found.

2. **Event Handling in GUI Systems**: User interface events are passed through a chain of components that can choose to handle or ignore them.

3. **Middleware in Web Frameworks**: HTTP request processing in frameworks like Express.js, where requests flow through a series of middleware functions.

4. **Logging Frameworks**: Systems like log4j use chains to determine how to process and filter log messages at different levels.

5. **Approval Workflows**: Business processes where requests (like expense reports) must go through a chain of approvers.

6. **Input Validation**: Form validation where input goes through a series of validators, each checking different aspects.

7. **ATM Banking Systems**: Transaction processing where different handlers manage different types of banking operations.

8. **Customer Support Escalation**: Help desk systems where issues are escalated to different support levels based on complexity.

9. **Security Checks**: Authentication and authorization systems where requests pass through multiple security filters.

10. **Document Processing Pipelines**: Document workflows where each step in the process transforms or validates the document in some way.
