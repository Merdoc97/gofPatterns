# Command Pattern

## Intent
The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations. The pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, logging of the requests, and supporting undoable operations. It promotes loose coupling between the sender (invoker) and the receiver by eliminating direct connections between them.

## Types of Command Pattern

1. **Basic Command**: The standard implementation with a command interface, concrete commands, a receiver that performs the actual work, and an invoker that executes commands.

2. **Undoable Command**: Extends the basic pattern with an undo capability, allowing operations to be reversed. Commands store state needed to undo their effects.

3. **Macro Command (Composite Command)**: A command that represents a sequence of commands. When executed, it executes all sub-commands in sequence.

4. **Lazy Command**: Delays the execution of a command until it's absolutely necessary, often used for optimization.

5. **Command Processor**: A specialized invoker that maintains a queue of commands and processes them according to a specific policy (e.g., FIFO, priority).

6. **Command Factory**: Uses the Factory pattern to create commands dynamically based on runtime conditions.

7. **Command History**: Maintains a history of executed commands, allowing for operations like undo/redo, replay, and audit trails.

8. **Parameterized Command**: Commands that can be configured with different parameters to change their behavior.

9. **Stateful Command**: Commands that maintain their own state, potentially changing behavior across executions.

10. **Null Command (No Operation Command)**: A command implementation that does nothing, used to simplify conditional logic in clients.

11. **Asynchronous Command**: Commands that execute asynchronously, often in a separate thread or process.

12. **Transactional Command**: Commands that provide transactional behavior, either succeeding completely or rolling back all changes if they fail.

## When to Use the Command Pattern

Use the Command pattern when:

1. **You want to parameterize objects with operations**: When you need to pass operations as parameters, store them, or vary them at runtime.

2. **You want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely**: When operations need to be stored for later execution or transmitted over a network.

3. **You need to implement reversible operations**: When you need to support undo functionality in your application.

4. **You want to structure a system around high-level operations built on primitive operations**: When complex operations can be broken down into simpler ones that can be reused.

5. **You want to decouple objects that execute commands from objects that issue commands**: When you want to separate the concerns of command execution from command invocation.

6. **You need to implement callbacks**: When you want to register and execute callbacks without hard-coding their receivers.

7. **You want to implement a transaction system**: When operations need to be applied atomically and potentially rolled back if they fail.

8. **You need to create a history of operations**: When you need to log operations for auditing, debugging, or replay purposes.

9. **You want to build a system with pluggable or extensible behaviors**: When behaviors should be easily added, removed, or exchanged without modifying existing code.

10. **You need to build a menu or button-based user interface**: When UI actions should be decoupled from their implementation.

## Real-World Examples

1. **GUI Development**: Menu items, buttons, and shortcuts are often implemented as commands to separate UI elements from the actions they trigger.

2. **Text Editors**: Commands are used to implement operations like typing, deleting, copying, and pasting text, with undo/redo capabilities.

3. **Transaction Processing Systems**: Banking and financial systems use commands to model transactions, ensuring they can be verified, logged, and potentially reversed.

4. **Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)**: Commands encapsulate method calls that can be serialized and sent over a network for remote execution.

5. **Job Queue Systems**: Background jobs in systems like Sidekiq or Delayed Job are essentially commands queued for later execution.

6. **Database Systems**: Transactions in databases are implemented as commands that can be committed or rolled back.

7. **Game Development**: User inputs, AI behaviors, and game actions are often modeled as commands for flexible execution and replay.

8. **Workflow and Business Process Management**: Steps in a workflow are represented as commands that can be executed, monitored, and potentially compensated.

9. **Home Automation**: Smart home systems use commands to control devices, often with the ability to schedule or queue operations.

10. **Mobile Applications**: Commands are used to implement offline capabilities, where operations are queued when the device is offline and executed when connectivity is restored.

11. **Version Control Systems**: Commits, merges, and other operations in Git and similar systems are essentially commands with detailed logging and reversibility.

12. **Web Applications**: Ajax requests and form submissions can be implemented as commands to standardize handling and provide fallback mechanisms.
