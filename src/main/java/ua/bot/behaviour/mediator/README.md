# Mediator Pattern

## Intent
The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an object (the mediator) that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it allows their interaction to be varied independently. The pattern centralizes complex communications and control between related objects, allowing them to be understood and maintained more easily.

## Types of Mediator Pattern

1. **Concrete Mediator**: The classic implementation where a concrete mediator class handles all communication between colleagues. This approach centralizes control but can lead to a large mediator class.

2. **Event-Based Mediator**: Uses events or messages rather than direct method calls to communicate between colleagues and the mediator. This approach is common in event-driven systems and UI frameworks.

3. **Interface-Based Mediator**: Uses interfaces for both the mediator and colleagues to provide a more flexible and extensible design with better abstraction.

4. **Observer-Based Mediator**: Combines the Mediator pattern with the Observer pattern, where the mediator acts as an observable object that colleagues can subscribe to.

5. **Hierarchical Mediator**: Organizes mediators in a hierarchy to handle complex systems with multiple levels of interaction, where each mediator handles a specific subset of colleagues.

6. **Stateful Mediator**: Maintains state that affects how messages are routed between colleagues, allowing for context-dependent communication.

7. **Command-Based Mediator**: Combines the Mediator pattern with the Command pattern, where commands are passed to the mediator, which then decides which colleagues should handle them.

8. **Asynchronous Mediator**: Handles communication between colleagues asynchronously, useful in distributed systems where components may be located on different threads or processes.

## When to Use the Mediator Pattern

Use the Mediator pattern when:

1. **A set of objects communicate in well-defined but complex ways**: When interactions between objects are numerous and complex, a mediator can simplify these interactions.

2. **Reusing an object is difficult because it refers to and communicates with many other objects**: When objects are tightly coupled with many others, a mediator can decouple them.

3. **You want to customize behavior distributed among several classes without creating too many subclasses**: When behavior that's distributed across multiple objects needs to be customized, a mediator can centralize that behavior.

4. **You find yourself creating many subclasses of components to customize their behavior**: When object behavior depends on its interaction with other objects, a mediator can encapsulate that interaction.

5. **You have multiple objects that need to communicate but should remain loosely coupled**: When you want to avoid direct dependencies between communicating objects.

6. **Communication logic changes frequently**: When the rules governing how objects interact change often, centralizing this logic in a mediator makes changes easier.

7. **The application has a large number of classes representing states or actions that need to know about each other**: When many classes need to be aware of changes in other classes.

8. **You want to avoid a "many-to-many" relationship between interacting objects**: When direct connections between all objects would create a complex and unmaintainable system.

## Real-World Examples

1. **Air Traffic Control Systems**: Air traffic controllers (mediators) coordinate the actions of multiple aircraft (colleagues) to ensure safe operations.

2. **Chat Applications**: A chat server acts as a mediator between multiple clients, routing messages to the appropriate recipients without them needing to know about each other.

3. **GUI Frameworks**: UI components communicate through mediators (controllers) rather than directly with each other, allowing for flexible UI designs.

4. **Event Management Systems**: Event buses or dispatchers act as mediators between event publishers and subscribers, decoupling the components.

5. **Booking Systems**: A booking service mediates between customers, service providers, and payment processors without them needing direct knowledge of each other.

6. **Telecommunication Systems**: Call routing systems mediate between callers and receivers, managing complex routing logic centrally.

7. **Stock Trading Platforms**: Trading platforms mediate between buyers, sellers, and market data providers, coordinating complex transactions.

8. **Smart Home Systems**: Central controllers mediate between various smart devices, allowing them to interact without direct coupling.

9. **Multiplayer Game Servers**: Game servers mediate interactions between players, handling communication and game state synchronization.

10. **Middleware Applications**: Enterprise service buses and other middleware act as mediators between different software systems, translating and routing messages.
