# Visitor Pattern

## Intent
The Visitor pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying them. It separates algorithms from the objects on which they operate, enabling you to define new operations without changing the classes of the elements on which they operate. The pattern uses a technique called double dispatch to call the appropriate method on the visitor, based on both the type of the visitor and the type of the element being visited.

## Types of Visitor Pattern

1. **Classic Visitor**: The traditional implementation with a visitor interface declaring visit methods for each concrete element, and concrete visitors implementing these methods. Elements declare an accept method that takes a visitor.

2. **Hierarchical Visitor**: An extension that handles hierarchical structures efficiently, often used with composite structures, allowing visitors to process parent-child relationships.

3. **Acyclic Visitor**: A variation that eliminates the dependency of the visitor interface on concrete element classes, using runtime type checking instead of static type checking.

4. **Reflective Visitor**: Uses reflection to determine the appropriate visit method at runtime, reducing the need for explicit visit methods for each element type but sacrificing compile-time type safety.

5. **Extrinsic Visitor**: Stores element state externally, allowing operations on elements without them knowing about the visitor's internal structure.

6. **Visitor with State**: Maintains state as it traverses an object structure, useful for operations that require accumulating results across multiple elements.

7. **Dispatch Visitor**: Uses multiple dispatch mechanisms, such as dynamic method resolution, to determine the appropriate visit method.

## When to Use the Visitor Pattern

Use the Visitor pattern when:

1. **You need to perform operations on all elements of a complex object structure**: When you have a composite structure like a tree, and need to perform operations that depend on the concrete classes of objects in the structure.

2. **You want to add new operations without changing the classes of the elements they operate on**: When the classes in your object structure are stable, but you need to define new operations on them.

3. **The object structure classes have many distinct and unrelated operations**: When you want to keep related operations together and separate them from the element classes.

4. **The object structure classes are part of a framework, but operations need to be specific to an application**: When the object structure comes from a library or framework, but the operations are application-specific.

5. **You want to accumulate state across an entire object structure traversal**: When your operations need to maintain state as they process each element in the structure.

6. **The classes defining the object structure rarely change, but new operations are frequently added**: When the class hierarchy is stable, but new functionality needs to be added regularly.

7. **You need to perform operations that require accessing the concrete classes of an object**: When you need operations that depend on the specific types of objects in your structure.

## Real-World Examples

1. **Compiler Design**: Visitors can be used to traverse abstract syntax trees in compilers, applying different operations like type checking, code generation, and optimization.

2. **Document Processing**: Document object models (like XML DOM) can use visitors to perform operations such as validation, transformation, or extraction across document elements.

3. **Graphical Editors**: Design tools use visitors to apply operations like rendering, exporting to different formats, or checking constraints on graphical objects.

4. **Financial Applications**: Visitors can process complex financial structures, applying operations like risk assessment or report generation.

5. **Game Development**: Game engines use visitors to implement operations like rendering, collision detection, or AI processing on game objects.

6. **UI Frameworks**: Component hierarchies in UI frameworks can use visitors to apply operations like layout management, event handling, or accessibility checks.

7. **Database Query Processing**: Query optimizers use visitors to transform and optimize query execution plans.

8. **Code Analysis Tools**: Static analysis tools use visitors to traverse code structures, finding bugs, calculating metrics, or enforcing coding standards.

9. **CAD Systems**: Computer-aided design systems apply visitors for operations like rendering, analysis, or export on complex 3D models.

10. **IoT Device Management**: Systems managing networks of IoT devices can use visitors to apply operations like configuration, monitoring, or updates across device hierarchies.
