# Prototype Pattern

## Intent
The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows cloning objects, even complex ones, without coupling to their specific classes. It provides a mechanism to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch, which may require accessing private fields that are not visible outside the class.

## Types of Prototype Pattern

1. **Simple Prototype**: Involves a prototype interface with a clone method and concrete implementations that handle their own cloning.

2. **Prototype Registry**: An extension of the simple prototype pattern that provides a registry or cache of available prototypes. Clients can retrieve and clone prototypes from this registry without knowing their concrete classes.

3. **Shallow Copy Prototype**: Creates a new instance of the same class and copies all the fields from the original object to the new one. If the field is a reference to another object, only the reference is copied (not the referred object).

4. **Deep Copy Prototype**: Creates a new instance of the same class and copies all the fields from the original object to the new one. If the field is a reference to another object, the referred object is also copied recursively.

## When to Use the Prototype Pattern

Use the Prototype pattern when:

1. **Your code shouldn't depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy**: The pattern provides a common interface for cloning objects, hiding the concrete classes from the client code.

2. **You want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize their objects**: Instead of creating subclasses to create objects with specific configurations, you can clone a pre-configured object.

3. **Creating an object is more expensive than copying an existing one**: If object creation involves costly operations (like database connections, file I/O, or complex calculations), cloning can be more efficient.

4. **Objects in your system have multiple combinations of state**: When your system needs to create many objects with various combinations of state, prototypes can simplify this process.

5. **You need to keep a history of object states**: The prototype pattern allows you to save snapshots of objects that can be restored later.

## Real-World Examples

1. **Document Editing**: When creating a new document, applications often start with a template (a prototype) rather than a blank document. Users can then modify this prototype to suit their needs.

2. **Graphic Design Tools**: Design applications allow users to create objects and then duplicate them to create similar objects with minor variations.

3. **Gaming Entities**: Game developers use prototypes to create multiple instances of similar game entities (enemies, obstacles, power-ups) without defining separate classes for each variation.

4. **Database Record Cloning**: Database applications may use prototypes to create new records based on existing ones, particularly for complex records with many fields or relationships.

5. **Virtual Machine Images**: Cloud computing services use prototype-like mechanisms to create new virtual machines from pre-configured images.

6. **Cell Division in Biology**: Natural cell division, where a cell creates a copy of itself, mirrors the prototype pattern.

7. **Configuration Objects**: Software that requires complex configuration objects can use prototypes to create variations of a base configuration.
